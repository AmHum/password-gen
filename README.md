# Password-Generator

## The basic concept was to modify the existing code so the password generator would function to specifications.

### Created multiple arrays containing all letters, numbers, and symbols.
### Added an event listener and function to the provided button element.
### Created 'if' statements to direct the user through window prompts, allowing them to select the exact criteria of their desired password type.
### Created parameters on the allowed response type so the browser accurately provides the desired outcome. 
### Added alerts to the user in the event that their input value would be considered 'invalid'.
